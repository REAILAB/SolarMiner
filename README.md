### Large-scale Mining Solar Energy Potential of mining areas by Vision Large Model and Satellite Imageries

This is the official website of SolarMiner. 

The source code of utilizing VLM (Vision Large Model) for the mine-site solar energy potential assessment has been published there.

Also, the referenced datas for the PV (Photovoltiac) simulation model construction, environmental and economical analysis were displayed here.

So, let us go step by step to know the SolarMiner works...
