### Large-scale Mining Solar Energy Potential of mining areas by Vision Large Model and Satellite Imageries

This is the official website of SolarMiner.

The source code of utilizing VLM (Vision Large Model) for the mine-site solar energy potential assessment has been published there.

Also, the referenced datas for the PV (Photovoltiac) simulation model construction, environmental and economical analysis were displayed here.

So, let us go step by step to know How the SolarMiner works...

## 1. What is SolarMiner?
### 1.1 Background
Installing PV systems in post-mining areas offers numerous advantages. However, there is currently a lack of algorithms capable of assessing the PV potential of mining areas on a large scale. Furthermore, the development of Float PV (FPV) technology has made it possible to install FPV systems in these areas. Therefore, we propose a model capable of conducting a wide-ranging assessment of the extensive potential of mining areas. This model, incorporating computer vision techniques, enables the calculation of potential installation areas for both FPV and traditional PV systems.

The code can also be used:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python.git
```
### 1.3 PV Models

Your can also use the source code, by pasting the following code in bash
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python.git
```
